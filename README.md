# Project Description

### ROADII Use Case - Land Use Classification

- **Title:** Categorizing Land Use on Roadways 
- **Purpose and goals of the project:**  
- **Purpose of the source code and how it relates to the overall goals of the project:** 
- **Length of the project:** This use case is currently in the exploratory phase.  


# Prerequisites

Requires:

# Usage

## Building

The [Code](https://github.com/ITSJPO-TRIMS/R25-IncidentDetection/tree/main/Code) folder contains the code and installation instructions of the ROADII-Lab exploration of the traffic incident detection use case. It will be populated with functions, model code, training parameters, and eductional materials to help potential users or stakeholders with the development process for the deployment of their own traffic incident detection system. 



## Testing

The development team is currently building testing functions. For now, the recommended testing is examining the results to ensure they line up with general knowledge of roads and upcoming weather trends. 

## Execution


The steps to running the code are as follows:
