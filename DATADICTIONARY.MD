## Overlap Percentages and Weighted Average Calculation

### Explanation of `block_ids` and `overlap_percs`:
1. **`block_ids`:**
   - A list of block IDs (`BLOCK_ID`) that overlap with the buffered geometry of the road.
   - Each road contains blocks whose boundaries intersect the **road buffer geometry**.

2. **`overlap_percs`:**
   - A list of overlap percentages corresponding to the blocks listed in `block_ids`.
   - Represents the proportion of the block area that overlaps with the road buffer area.

### Weighted Average Calculation:
Columns such as `agg_pop`, `agg_area`, `agg_ctsm`, `agg_hght`, `agg_sback`, and `agg_bldprc` are calculated as **weighted averages** based on overlap percentages.

#### Formula for Weighted Average:
For a metric `M` (e.g., `bld_area`, `avg_hght`):
1. Normalize the overlap percentages:
   ```math
   normalized_weight = overlap_percentage / total_overlap_percentage
2. Multiply each block's metric by its normalized weight:
   ```math
   Weighted Metric = Î£ (block_metric * normalized_weight)
